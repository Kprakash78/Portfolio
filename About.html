       <h2>Something about my self</h2>

I’m Kshiteej Prakash, a curious and driven learner currently in my first year of college. I have a strong interest in programming, data science, and machine learning,<br>and I’ve already built a good foundation in C++  as well as Python.

I enjoy exploring how things work at a deeper level—whether it’s understanding computer architecture topics like opcodes, addressing modes, and RTL, or diving into<br>practical coding with Python, Pandas, and beginner-level ML projects.

I’m not afraid to ask “why” at every step, and I try to build concepts from the ground up, which helps me grow steadily as a programmer. I’m also experimenting <br> with web development and aiming to build a portfolio to showcase my projects.

Outside of academics, I’m focused on developing problem-solving skills, balancing between exploring niche areas (like compiler design) and mainstream tracks<br>like AI/ML and web development.
